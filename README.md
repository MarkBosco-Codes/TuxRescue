## Background
My first event as an Exco Member at NYP InfoSec was an Intro to Linux Workshop - where we helped new members set up a Linux Virtual Machine and showed them around the command line interface. I created the TuxRescue challenge as a fun finale activity, where participants could put their new skills to practice cracking a challenge typical of our biannual CTF competitions.

TuxRescue appeared again at NYP's Youth Cyber Exploration Program in 2022, as part of a series of lessons introducing secondary school students to basic cybersecurity skills.

## How To Play
1. Download the challenge file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M8e8cUliJwthKtN1bAPZw_sI5lG2FQ4W/view?usp=sharing).
2. Copy the folder to a Linux machine (or virtual machine), and unzip it.
3. Refer to `instructions.md` for the challenge questions.
4. If you're stuck, take a peek inside TUX_HINTS.zip. Password: `FEEDBACK18`. 


Don't have a Linux machine? Here's NYP InfoSec's [Kali Linux Virtual Machine guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-0Zw5csHRWN5aEPBWzG5d1bh0H4ET2Jz38X7I-dsvtc/).


Unfortunately, TuxRescue doesn't work Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
