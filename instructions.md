Mini-CTF Treasure Hunt
==============================

Dear Agent [YOUR NAME HERE]:

Our favourite Linux mascot, Tux, has been captured! The evil Dragon Inc. is keeping him hostage in their office. 

To release Tux, you will need to find six (6) flags around the Dragon Inc. building. 
Then, combine the contents of each flag (without the number and curly braces) to get the secret password.
Finally, find where Tux is being kept and extract him using the secret password.

Good luck!

====================
*MISSIONS:*

Enter Dragon Inc (unzip the folder `unzip `). Look at the cat.
Flag 1: 

The second flag is hidden in plain sight.
Flag 2: 

The third flag is in a safe in the Study.
Create a text file called "PASSCODE" with the contents "TUXISHERE". Then find a way to open the safe.
Flag 3: 


The fourth flag is in the Robotics Lab. The flag has been hidden on a special microchip that can only be read by a robot. Create a robot and give it the microchip to reveal the flag.
Create a user called 'ROBOT'. Make ROBOT the owner and group owner of the document called 'MICROCHIP'.
Give read (r), write (w) and execute (x) permissions to the owner (ROBOT), but only read (r) permissions to the group and everyone else.

Run the command './activate' to read the microchip.
You may delete the user 'ROBOT' after you get this flag.
Flag 4: 


The clone lab is under attack by dragon clones! Each dragon produces a different output, but only one will reveal the flag.
Flag 5:


Last flag! This one his hidden high up in the building. No one has beaten 3-second parkour course yet. Will you be the first?
Flag 6:
